with st.expander("📌 Goal of This Visualization", expanded=True):
    st.markdown("""
    _Is the viewer’s attention firmly focused on key moments, or does it float, drifting between different scenes in search of something new?_

    The goal of this visualization is to understand how viewers engage with a video by examining **where and how they focus their attention**. By comparing the areas where viewers look (represented by **convex and concave hulls**), the visualization highlights whether their attention stays focused on a specific part of the video or shifts around.

    Ultimately, this helps us uncover **patterns of focus and exploration**, providing insights into how viewers interact with different elements of the video.

with st.expander("📐 Explain Convex and Concave Concept"):
    st.markdown("""
    To analyze visual attention, we enclose gaze points with geometric boundaries:

    - **Convex Hull** wraps around all gaze points to show the overall extent of where viewers looked.
    - **Concave Hull** creates a tighter boundary that closely follows the actual shape of the gaze pattern, adapting to gaps and contours in the data.

    👉 **The difference in area between them reveals how dispersed or concentrated the viewers’ gaze is.**

with st.expander("📊 Focus-Concentration (F-C) Score"):
    st.markdown("""
    The **Focus Concentration Score (FCS)** quantifies how focused or scattered a viewer’s attention is during the video:

    - A score **close to 1** → gaze is tightly grouped → **high concentration**.
    - A score **much lower than 1** → gaze is more spread out → **lower concentration / more exploration**.

    It helps to measure whether attention is **locked onto a specific spot** or **wandering across the frame**.

    st.markdown("**High F-C Score**: The viewer’s gaze remains focused in one tight area, suggesting strong interest or attention.")
